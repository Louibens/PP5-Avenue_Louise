            <div class="text-center p-2">Passionate about eco-conscious living, I'm on a journey to reimagine the possibilities of everyday objects. My heart beats for textiles, and I'm on a mission to source unwanted fabrics and breathe new life into them, creating unique, sustainable pieces.<br>Weaving has become my meditation, a mindful practice that connects me to the beauty of each thread.
                <br>
                But my passion doesn't end there. I dream of teaching future generations the art of crafting, not just for aesthetics but with a deep consideration for our planet's impact. I want to empower them to create beautiful pieces that stand the test of time and inspire them to repair, not replace, so that together, we can weave a more sustainable future.</div>
